	<h2>History</h2>
	
	<p> The idea for the league only came about in early 2019, it all sparked from when Jay Peniamina, a former student and one of the best players to play the game, took us to the woodwork room and showed us how we could play table tennis within the room. At first we all thought he was crazy as the tables seemed too small, it took some getting used to and some painful losses until we got the hang of the game and could hold actual rallies that would last for ages if we got really into it. Jay did not know what was about to come of his idea, as in the years to come, with a lot of trialing and errors the table Tennis WoodWork league was born or TTWL for short with the help of jack maffey. The name of the league took a while to come across as the vice leader (Matt Sims) and the leader of the league (Noah Rooney) had a disagreement with what the acronym of the league should be Noah thought it should be TTWWL while Matt thought it should be TTWL, this took a good few months to come to a conclusion but the name for the league was agreed to be TTWL. </p>

	<p>The rules of the league have changed over the years with new ones being added as well as being removed to help compensate for people within the league for example the ability to back hand the ball back over the net if you were unable to move the paddle to the ball Naoh Rooney one of the players popularized it and became really good to the point where a discussion was brought up, to make a rule so that you had to use the paddle to get the ball over so the rules were changed. The players need to adapt and overcome these changes to become the best in their league.
