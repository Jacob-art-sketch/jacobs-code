		<h2>Brief Summary of The league</h2>
	<p> TTWL is an acronym for Table Tennis WoodWork League. This league was created by students in Otago boys’ high school. All games happened with the hours of 8 in the morning until 1:15 in the afternoon. The main idea was to make sure we wouldn’t get bored before school. Then it grew from there.</p>
	
	
		<h2>Rules of the League</h2>
	<p>The rules of the league are there are no rules, well kinda, it's first to 5 no lead by 2 just first to 5, you are welcome to use anything within the room of course within reason and that It doesn’t violate the rules of health and safety. Bring your own ball as you are responsible for if it breaks. All parts of the vice are in play from serve. Serves are done how you would traditionally do a table tennis serve.</p> <p>The league pretty much follows the rules of a normal table tennis league. Apart from when it hits the roof, another table someone's work that happens to be on the floor and the ball makes its way back to the table without it hitting another player or spectator the rally carries on. Once the ball hits the floor then the rally ends and a point is awarded to the player that won the rally.
